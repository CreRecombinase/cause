CAUSE is a Mendelian Randomization method using genome-wide summary statistics. CAUSE models both horizontal and correlated pleiotropy in order to avoid false positives that can occur using other methods. 

In this website you will find:

+ A tutorial on how to use the cause R package
+ Instructions for replicating simulations in the paper
+ Instructions for replicating data analysis in the paper (coming soon)
