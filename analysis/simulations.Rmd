## Introduction

Simulations are run using the `causeSims` R package. The package can be downloaded using

```
devtools::install_github("jean997/causeSims")
```

This package relies on multiple R packages that are not on CRAN, so you will need to download these separately. 
For detailed installation instructions including installation of supporting R packages for other methods and a detailed description of the package see [here](https://github.com/jean997/causeSims).

We also use the [Dynamical Statisical Comparisons](https://stephenslab.github.io/dsc-wiki/overview) software.
