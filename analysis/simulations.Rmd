## Simulated Data Experiments

Simulations are run using the `causeSims` R package. The package can be downloaded using

```
devtools::install_github("jean997/causeSims")
```

This package relies on multiple R packages that are not on CRAN, so you will need to download these separately. 
For detailed installation instructions including installation of supporting R packages for other methods and a detailed description of the package see [here](https://github.com/jean997/causeSims). There you can also find
a detailed walk through of a single simulation and explanations of the functions contained in the package.


We conduct simulations using the [Dynamical Statisical Comparisons](https://stephenslab.github.io/dsc-wiki/overview) software.  DSC files for executing the experiments presented in the paper can be found here: [power](https://github.com/jean997/causeSims/blob/master/power.dsc), [false positives](https://github.com/jean997/causeSims/blob/master/false_positives.dsc)

To execute them, use the following commands (on a compute cluster)
```
nohup dsc --replicate 100 --host config.yml -c 4 pwr.dsc > pwr_dsc.out &
nohup dsc --replicate 100 --host config.yml -c 4 false_positives.dsc > fp_dsc.out &
```
You will need to modify the `config.yml` file to be specific to your compute cluster.
