## Summary Statistic Mendelian Randomizatoin Basics

Mendelian randomization (MR) is a method for inferring causal effects from observational data by using genetic variants as insturmental variables. 
The key idea of MR is to treat genotypes as naturally occurring "randomizations" (@Smith2014,@Boef2015,@Zheng2017).
Suppose we are interested in the causal effect of trait $M$ (for "Mediator") on trait $Y$.
The simplest MR methods assume that we can identify a genetic variant $G_j$, that meets two assumptions:

1. $G_j$ causally affects $M$
2. $G_j$ has no affects on $Y$ that are not mediated through $M$

These assumptions are illustrated in the following figure:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("cause_figure_1_standalone.png", dpi=NA)
```

Here we have divided assumption 2 into two parts. First the variant may not affect any confounders/shared factors that act on both $M$ and $Y$ (correlated pleiotropy) and second, the variant cannot have any affects on $Y$ through a non-shared mechanism (uncorrelated pleiotropy). 

If  these assumptions hold thenthe associations of $G_j$ with traits $M$ and $Y$ will satisfy

$$
\beta_{Y,j} = \gamma \beta_{M,j},
$$
where $\beta_{Y,j}$ is the association of $G_j$ with $Y$, $\beta_{M,j}$ is the association of $G_j$ with $M$ and $\gamma$ is the causal effect of $M$ on $Y$. This relationship is the core of simple MR methods. Many methods based on Equation \eqref{eq:mr}, including the commonly used inverse variance weighted (IVW) regression, first obtain estimates
of $\beta_{Y,j}$ and $\beta_{M,j}$ for several genetic variants $G_j$, and then 
estimate $\gamma$ by regressing the estimates of $\beta_{Y,j}$ on the estimates of $\beta_{M,j}$ (@Burgess2016).


## Violating MR Assumptions

Correlated and uncorrelated pleiotropy are both forms of what has been previously termed horizontal pleiotropy. However, they have different effects on MR estimators. In uncorrelated pleiotropy, horizontal pleiotropic effects of variants are uncorrelated with effects on $M$. Thas adds a noise term to the relationship above. On the other hand, when some variants exhibit correlated pleiotropy, this can induce an average correaltion between effect estimates even when the causal effect is equal to zero. This makes correlated pleiotropy more difficult to account for. 

Several proposals have been made for accounting for horizontal pleiotropy in MR. However, most of these rely on the assumption that all horizontal pleiotropy is uncorrelated. These include 
 Egger regression (@Bowden2015,@Barfield2017) which adds an intercept term to the regression of $\hat{\beta}_{Y,j}$ on $\hat{\beta}_{M,j}$, 
and several methods that rely on outlier removal including GSMR (@Zhu2018) and MR-PRESSO (@Verbanck2018).
Another proposal, 
the weighted median estimator(@Bowden2016), makes no assumptions about the form of horizontal pleiotropy but assumes that fewer than half the variants exhibit horizontal pleiotropy.

The figures below demonstrate how correlated pleiotropy can lead to false positives using simple MR methods. On the left we have simulated data with no causal effect but 15% of the variants have correlated pleiotropic effecgts on $Y$ (blue triangles). Even though there are many variants with strong association with $M$ and no association with $Y$ (evidence against a causal effect) IVW regression obtains a $p$-value of 0.01. We would like to be able to distinguish this scenario from the scenario on the right. On the right, we have simulated data with a true causal effect. Effect estimates are correlated for all varaints.
