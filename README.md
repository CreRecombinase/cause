CAUSE: Causal Analysis Using Summary Effect Estimates
======

This R package implements the CAUSE method described in Morrison et al 2018 (pre-print coming soon). This repository is actively being updated and is right at this moment not well documented but the package should work. Here is what to expect very soon:

* Working vignettes
* Summary of results in the paper and code for replicating
* A pre-print!



To install:
```{r}
devtools::install_git("https://github.com/jean997/cause.git")
```
